# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project demonstrates the application of Logistic Regression for predicting heart disease using Python and machine learning libraries like scikit-learn and pandas. The dataset used contains various medical attributes, and the model aims to classify whether an individual has a heart condition or not.



# Features:
Data preprocessing and cleaning.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for better insights.
Training and evaluation of a Logistic Regression model.
Accuracy metrics on both training and test data.
Predictive system to classify heart disease based on user input.


# Objective:
To provide a practical demonstration of machine learning in healthcare, facilitating early diagnosis and preventive care for heart disease.
